This is my own personal website, built with Jekyll. It also holds my own personal blog.

It was built with a few goals in mind:

* Responsive design: the website looks and behaves well on screens of all sizes;
* Fast: it only loads what's needed for it to work. No external JS or CSS libraries:
* Adaptive: it supports dark mode from most operating systems by default (desktop and mobile);
* No tracking: I don't need to know who you are and what you do. No tracking nor analytics;
* Pretty: use a simple and organized layout with simple animations to provide a pleasant experience to all visitors.

I achieved this with the help of Jekyll and SASS. There is little to no JavaScript. Instead of showing what I can do with JS, I think it's important to show that I know when it's not needed.
